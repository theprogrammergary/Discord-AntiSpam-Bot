## Discord Anti-spam Bot 🤖

### About 
##### Scammers join open/free discord servers of popular influencers and often try to imitate said influencer. They DM users of the server pretending to be an influencer and offer fake products/services scamming innocent people. Banning/Moderating of these users would require monitoring 24/7 so this bot was created. 

##### It checks all users credentials against moderators. If their credentials match too closely to a moderator then that user is banned or kicked. User credentials are checked when users either join the server or update their credentials. 

## Enjoy and 🖕🏼 you scammers.
